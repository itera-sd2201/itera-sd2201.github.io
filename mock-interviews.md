# Mock Interview
In addition to hosting office hours, our Google Engineers on course staff will provide free mock interviews to you based on the material that you've learned in the class and the requirements of the STEP internship. 

### What are real interviews like? Advice and Tips/Tricks?

Watch [this video talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG5860rWppA){:target="_blank"} given by Marc Cohen at Howard this semester. You can find the [slides here](mco.fyi/interview){:target="_blank"}.

### What will the mock interviews be like?

The goal of the interviews is to simulate what real technical interviews may be like with various companies, so you can better understand what to expect. The goal of these interviews specifically is *not* to teach you brand new content (e.g. a question requires a data structure but you’ve never heard of it before), so please tell your mock interviewer if they are asking you something you haven’t learned yet.

Your interviewer will come prepared with a question (or maybe a few, depending on question difficulty). Don’t be afraid to ask clarifying questions - the interview should feel more like a conversation and less like an interrogation. If something is confusing, talk through it with your interviewer and they can help push you in the right direction.

Afterwards, your interviewer will provide you with feedback as well as tips on how to improve your interviewing skills. 

### What are some good resources to help you prepare?

- Review [content learned in class](https://csci100.org/calendar/){:target="_blank"}
- [CodingBat Practice Problems](https://codingbat.com/python){:target="_blank"} has good warmup problems to practice with
- [Cracking the Coding Interview](https://www.crackingthecodinginterview.com/){:target="_blank"} is a solid book to learn or review core CS concepts and how to use them in interviews. For freshmen, this book is a bit too advanced - but as you take CS1 and CS2, you should start practicing from this book.
- [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/){:target="_blank"} and [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/){:target="_blank"} have tons of practice questions with automatic testing

If after one mock interview you want further experience, consider spending 2-3 weeks working on practice problems and then schedule a second session with a different interviewer.
